# KAW Texture Coordinates (Name subject to change.)
This was made to help with mapping out textures for Konosuba: Judgement on this Greedy Game! Because manually determining is pretty tedious and time consuming.
## How to use:
1. Open this site: 
2. Obtain texture file(s) and JSON by decompiling PSB with Freemote.
3. Upload Texture and JSON files to site.
4. Select corresponding texture from texture drop down.
5. Select an Icon and the coordinates will be shown along with a pin point for where the item is located.
## Known working games:
- Konosuba: Judgement on this Greedy Game!
- Plastic Memories
## To Dos:
- Allow for naming of Icons. (Maybe update the metadata field?)
- Add coordinate remapping.
- Add JSON editing/saving.
