# KAW Texture Pinpointer
This was made to help with mapping out textures for Konosuba: Judgement on this Greedy Game! Because manually mapping is pretty tedious and time consuming.
## Features:
- Displays an uploaded texture on screen with the ability to pinpoint a location from its corresponding JSON.
- Update key values for "top", "left", "originX", "originY", "height", "width", and save them as an updated JSON file for easier texture remapping.
- Allows Icons to be properly named by using the "metadata" key.
## How to use:
1. Open this site: https://yunyunsfriends.github.io/KaleidoADV-Texture-Coordinates/
2. Obtain texture file(s) and JSON by decompiling PSB with Freemote.
3. Upload Texture and JSON files to site.
4. Select corresponding texture from texture drop down.
5. Select an Icon and the coordinates will be shown along with a pin point for where the item is located.
## Known working games:
- Konosuba: Judgement on this Greedy Game!
- Plastic Memories

Most texture/JSON combos from Kaleido ADV Workshop games should work.
